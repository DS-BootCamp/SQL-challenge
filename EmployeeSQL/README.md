# SQL-challenge
This folder has the following: 
1- Tables as the data appeared in the CSVs
2- ERD
3- Queries

Note: I tried running it in https://sqliteonline.com/ instead of Postgress..
Improvments to come: 
* Try run the whole thing in Posgres
* Try to write cleaner, more acurate queries..
* ERD could be better!
